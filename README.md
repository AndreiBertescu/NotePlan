NotePlan is an app where you can centralize all your events and notes. The app itself is built using Spring Boot and Spring Security. All data is stored on a MySQL server, and communication between the database and the Java applet is facilitated by Hibernate. I have designed all the various web pages for the app, except for the semantic calendar, which was inspired by a YouTube video. [Video link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVgmpm4z5U&t=1939s).

# Notes:
- To acces the website use the URL: http://localhost/noteplan.com/

# Roadmap:
- Add the checklist functionality for the notes.
- Make the website compatible with smaller screen displays.
- Develop a mobile app version of NotePlan.

# Version 1.1:
- Added a proper URL name
- Added small features to the web page.
- Made central calendar responsive to the events on the left.

# Version 1.0:
- Achieved minimum viable product!
- Added "save event" and "save note" functionality.
- Added input size limits on the html pages and sql database.
- Added ability to view events and notes.
- Added ability to delete and update events and notes.
- Small visual changes

# Version 0.9:
- The project was added on GitHub.
- The account system was fully completed: you can now register using only an email address and password. An email verification system was added to ensure there is only one account per email address.
- The HTML dashboard page, the main page of the project, is mostly finished. Small modifications can still be made, though.
